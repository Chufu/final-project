Project Name : Tank Battle
Project Goal : Ternibate all enemies in Maze

Key challenge : control the tank by keyboard, because its friction is small, it is really smooth. I design the control system by using keyboard. And most challenging thing to me is design the maze, I have to design the maze by pointing the coordinate and measure the thickness.

Since the user has docker installed, he or she just need to type esm start in terminal, then open a browser and navigate to http://localhost, and type enviro in terminal, then you will get the game

Game Instruction:
"w' is moving forward, "s" is moving backward, "a" is turning left, and "d" is turnning right. There is shooting system on robot, just need to enter space then you can shoot the bullet to terminate your enemy.
And just for information, if the tank crashes on your enemy, then both you and your enemy will die.
When the game is over, you can type ctrl c in terminal to quit.
You can enter enviro again in terminal to restart the game.
If you die in your game, do the above two lines.(line 11 and line 12)

I used enviro and quoted some codes from professor. And idea is from real game "Battle City".
